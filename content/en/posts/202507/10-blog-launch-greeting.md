Today, I've decided to start a tech blog once again.

I wrote "once again" because I've actually tried and given up on blogging multiple times before. Yet here I am, launching yet another new blog - humans are truly mysterious creatures. I'm honestly quite skeptical about whether this one will last, but I'm going to give it a try anyway.

There's a question lingering in my mind: Is there any point in writing a blog in this age of AI boom? Come to think of it, I rarely read blogs myself these days. When I have a technical problem, I just ask AI first and get it solved.

But that AI has evolved by learning from the vast amount of text that humans have written over the years. In other words, AI exists today because humans have continued to write. If that's the case, then writing blogs shouldn't be meaningless even now (probably). Maybe this blog will become training data for future AI.

I've written various things, but in the end, I'm doing this simply because I want to. Nothing more, nothing less. Meaning is something that comes afterward. I don't know how long this will continue, but I plan to update it leisurely whenever I feel like it.

Nice to meet you all.
